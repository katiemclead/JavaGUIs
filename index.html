  <h3>What's a JFrame Object?</h3>
  <p>It's just a container! We are going to fill that container up with stuff! How fun is that?</p>
  <p>Look at the example above. We took that container, and gave it a title, a size, a little x in the top right hand corner, and made it visible (after we set it up just the way we wanted it). Here is a link to <a href = "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html"> everything we can do to a JFrame</a>.</p>
